## Estimating the outcome of a Texas hold'em game using Monte Carlo simulation
In this project, we demonstrate how we can simulate the outcome of a Texas Hold'em poker game given a personal hand and the first 3 community (table) cards (flop round).
The code simulates the game from this point onwards and return the expectations of the win, lose or split probabilities for the given personal hand.
